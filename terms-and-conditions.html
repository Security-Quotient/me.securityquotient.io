      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Welcome to Security Quotient. Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are

        </p>
        <p>Security Quotient is a registered trademark of Security Quotient Pvt. Ltd. The website securityquotient.io
          and the associated web services provided through the website is owned by Security Quotient Pvt. Ltd.</p>
        <p>By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.</p>
        <p>Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements (including age
          requirements) may apply. Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional
          terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.</p>
        <br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Using our Services</h3>
        <p>You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services. Don’t misuse our Services. For
          example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and
          the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable
          export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you
          do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct. Using our Services
          does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You
          may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted
          by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t
          remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services. Our Services display some
          content that is not ours. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We
          may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to
          display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily
          mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do. In connection with your use of the Services,
          we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt-out of some
          of those communications.</p><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Your Security Quotient Account</h3>
        <p>You may need a Security Quotient account in order to use some of our Services. You may create your own
          Security Quotient Account, or your Security Quotient Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such
          as your employer. If you are using a Security Quotient Account assigned to you by an administrator, different
          or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.</p><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Privacy and Copyright Protection</h3>
        <p>Our privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our
          Services. By using our Services, you agree that Security Quotient can use such data in accordance with our
          privacy policies. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat
          infringes. We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you
          think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you may do so by contacting us.</p><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Your Content in our Services</h3>
        <p>Some of our Services allow you to submit content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights
          that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours. When you upload or otherwise submit
          content to our Services, you give Security Quotient (and those we work with) a worldwide license to host and
          store the content during the period of your usage of the Services. The purpose of hosting and storing the
          content is to enable you to use our Services as best as possible. We will not use your content for any other
          purpose whatsoever. Once you cease using our services, you may delete the content that you have uploaded or
          otherwise submitted as per your discretion.

          part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code
          of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission. Open source
          software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license
          that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the an open-source license that expressly
          override some of these terms.</p><br>

          we may suspend or stop a Service altogether. You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be
          sorry to see you go. Security Quotient may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to
          our Services at any time. We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is
          important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice
          and a chance to get information out of that Service.</p><br>
      </div>

      <div>

        <p>If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold
          harmless and indemnify Security Quotient and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim,
          suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any
          liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’
          fees.</p><br>
      </div>

      <div class="pb-5">
        <h3>About these Terms</h3>
        <p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to
          the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications
          to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes
          will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted.
          However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective
          immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that
          Service.</p>
        <p>If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for
          that conflict. These terms control the relationship between Security Quotient and you. They do not create any
          third-party beneficiary rights. If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away,
          this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>
        <p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The laws of
          India will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising
          out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the courts of Ernakulam
          District, Kerala, India. You and Security Quotient consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>
