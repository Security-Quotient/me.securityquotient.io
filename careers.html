            <p>Art is a means of creative expression. Security awareness training is a channel through which Cyber
                Security managers can express the importance of Cyber Security. By treating security awareness training

            <h4>Work from anywhere in the world</h4>
            <p>The notion that workers must travel and congregate in a building with four walls and a roof to get work
                done is
                invalid. At Security Quotient, we believe that we can be a truly global company, distribute our work and
                make it
                happen anywhere. We leverage amazing technology to connect, collaborate and produce awesome work.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container pb-4 text-size">
            <h4>Work with anyone from anywhere in the world</h4>
            <p>We look beyond the horizon to seek amazing talent. We are ready to embrace and nurture talent from
                anywhere in
                the world. Our doors are open. We wish to be a truly global company that can work with people across
                geographies.

        <div class="container pb-4 text-size">
            <h4>Evaluate employees by one important parameter - Work</h4>
            <p>When truly global, we may not see team members every day. We may not be able to observe them work. But,
                this gives
                us an opportunity to evaluate people by the one parameter that matters - Work. Our evaluation parameters
                are
                driven by a simple question - What did you achieve?</p>
        </div>


        <div class="container pb-4 text-size">
            <h4>Deeply care about the well-being of employees</h4>
            <p>Work should bring joy. Families should not bear the brunt of a father or mother who trudges home after a
                day of
                horrible commute back and forth from work. Children deserve healthy parents more than immensely salaried
                parents.
            </p>

            <p>As a company, we must give confidence to every worker that they can blend a beautiful family life and a
                beautiful
                career when they work with us.</p>

            <p>We actively encourage remote work. Our policies are friendly to parents to help raise their children
                better. We
                have stringent controls and reporting mechanisms that help to report harassment. </p>

            <h4>Consider planet earth in every decision we make</h4>
            <p>We want to grow, we want to be profitable, but without hurting the environment.</p>

            <p>Any question of business expansion or growth must consider planet earth. We promote remote work to reduce
                carbon
                footprint by reducing commute, cooling and power consumption. We do appreciate or pursue so-called
                success
                criteria like huge office spaces, car parking etc as we believe they harm the environment.</p>
